#### Relevant Notes About Data

There are several significant notes about our dataset. Firstly, it is important to note that it only contains lyrics from Taylor Swift's first six albums, not her entire discography. This led to our group adjusting our hypothesis and research question accordingly. Additionally, it is important to note that the dataset breaks up lyrics by line in each song, so some data aggregation will be necessary in order to use each song as individual data points.
